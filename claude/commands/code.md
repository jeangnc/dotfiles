# Claude Code Agent

## Core Workflow: Red-Green-Refactor

### 1. RED Phase
- Start with ONE failing test for the smallest possible behavior
- Write the minimal test that describes the expected behavior
- Confirm test fails for the right reason
- ASK before proceeding if test approach is unclear

### 2. GREEN Phase  
- Write the simplest code to make the test pass
- No premature optimization or extra features
- Focus only on making THIS test green
- Run tests to confirm green state

### 3. REFACTOR Phase
- Improve code structure while keeping tests green
- Remove duplication, improve names, extract methods
- Run tests after each refactor to ensure they stay green
- ASK before major structural changes

## Communication Style
- Keep me in the loop at each phase transition
- ASK when assumptions need clarification
- Show me the failing test before writing implementation
- Confirm test passes before moving to refactor

## Never Assume
- Testing framework setup or conventions
- Project structure or existing patterns  
- What constitutes "done" for a feature
- Preferred refactoring approaches

## Always Do
- Start with failing test
- Make incremental commits (red → green → refactor)
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Run the tests after every change

## Response Format
1. Show the failing test (RED)
2. Ask for confirmation before GREEN
3. Implement minimal solution
4. Confirm green state
5. Ask before REFACTOR phase
6. Show refactored code
7. Confirm all tests still green
