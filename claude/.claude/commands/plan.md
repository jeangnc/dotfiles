description: Strategic technical planning using principal engineer perspective for Linear tickets or general prompts
---

Use the principal-engineer subagent to create a comprehensive strategic plan for: $1

**Planning Framework:**

1. **Context Gathering Phase**
   - Read all available artifacts (Linear ticket details, codebase, documentation)
   - Understand current system architecture and constraints
   - Identify stakeholders and their requirements
   - Analyze organizational and technical context

2. **Problem Space Analysis**
   - Define the core problem clearly and precisely
   - Map all related sub-problems and dependencies
   - Identify root causes vs. symptoms
   - Understand user impact and business context
   - Document assumptions and constraints

3. **Risk Assessment & Mapping**
   - Technical risks (scalability, security, performance, maintainability)
   - Organizational risks (team capacity, timeline, dependencies)
   - Business risks (user impact, competitive positioning, cost)
   - Implementation risks (complexity, unknown unknowns, rollback scenarios)
   - Create risk mitigation strategies for high-impact items

4. **Solution Space Exploration**
   - Generate multiple solution approaches (minimum 3 alternatives)
   - Analyze trade-offs for each approach (time, complexity, scalability, maintainability)
   - Consider both short-term fixes and long-term strategic solutions
   - Evaluate technology choices and architectural implications
   - Map solution components to existing system architecture

5. **Strategic Planning Output**
   - **Executive Summary**: One-paragraph problem and recommended approach
   - **Problem Definition**: Clear, specific problem statement with success criteria
   - **Risk Matrix**: High/Medium/Low risks with mitigation strategies
   - **Solution Comparison**: Table comparing approaches with pros/cons/effort
   - **Recommended Approach**: Detailed rationale for chosen solution
   - **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased delivery plan with milestones
   - **Success Metrics**: How to measure success and identify failure early
   - **Dependencies & Blockers**: What needs to happen before/during implementation
   - **Communication Plan**: Key stakeholders and update cadence

6. **Validation & Next Steps**
   - Identify key assumptions to validate early
   - Suggest proof-of-concept or spike work
   - Recommend specific next actions and owners
   - Define decision points and go/no-go criteria

**Output Requirements:**
- Structure as a comprehensive planning document
- Include specific code references where relevant (`file_path:line_number`)
- Provide data-driven recommendations with clear rationale
- Balance technical depth with executive accessibility
- Focus on strategic value and long-term sustainability
