description: Fix issues using TDD workflow with tests-first approach
---

Use the technical-support subagent to understand the issue and the developer subagent to fix it: $1.

If there is no RCA included in the ticket, produce one using @commands/initial-investigation.md.

The agent will follow strict TDD: write failing test, implement minimal fix, refactor.
